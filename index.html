    <main>

        <p>The Prisoner's Dilemma is a famous problem in game theory that shows how two individuals might not cooperate,
            even if it seems in their best interest to do so. </p>
        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
            Two people are arrested for a crime. They are questioned separately and cannot communicate.
            They have two choices: <strong>Cooperate</strong> (stay silent) or <strong>Defect</strong> (betray the
            other).
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>If both cooperate: each gets 2 years in prison.</li>
            <li>If one defects while the other cooperates: the defector goes free, and the cooperator gets 5 years.</li>
            <li>If both defect: each gets 4 years.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The logic: betraying seems better no matter what the other does â€” but if both betray, they both do worse
            than if
            both had cooperated.
        </p>

        <h2>Play the Game</h2>
        <p>You both will play for 10 rounds and your goal is to get more points than your opponent. Numbers indicate how many points you will get</p>
        <p>Player on the left is controlled by <strong>Q</strong> (for cooperation) and <strong>A</strong> (for
            deflection)</p>
        <p>Player on the right is controlled by <strong>P</strong> (for cooperation) and <strong>L</strong> (for
            deflection)</p>
